1. Evaluate Technical Execution - Assess the photograph's technical mastery including proper exposure and lighting, thoughtful composition and framing, effective use of focus and depth of field, and overall clarity of the image. This task determines whether the photographer has demonstrated command of their craft and created a foundation upon which quality can be built.

2. Assess Visual Clarity and Subject Distinctness - Determine how effectively the cat stands out from its background and environment, evaluate the sharpness and rendition of the cat's key features (eyes, fur texture, expression), and gauge how efficiently the image communicates its subject. This task measures whether the viewer can see and understand the photograph's primary subject without confusion or visual obstruction.

3. Recognize Authentic Feline Expression and Character - Identify genuine moments that reveal the cat's unique personality, nature, and emotional state, evaluate whether the photograph captures a truthful representation of the cat's character rather than a staged or artificial moment, and assess how effectively the image conveys something meaningful about the individual animal. This task celebrates the photograph's ability to transcend mere documentation and reveal authentic nature.

4. Rate Compositional Appeal and Emotional Engagement - Evaluate the overall visual and emotional impact of the composition, determine whether the image invites and sustains viewer attention, assess the mood and atmosphere created by the photograph, and measure how successfully the image moves, delights, or inspires the viewer. This task captures whether the photograph succeeds as a complete artistic statement that goes beyond technical competence.

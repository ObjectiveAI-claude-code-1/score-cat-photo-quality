Score each individual cat photo for technical quality and visual clarity. Evaluate sharpness and focus on the cat, appropriateness and quality of lighting that reveals detail and texture, clarity of fine details, and accuracy of color reproduction. A technically sound photograph that is in focus with good lighting allows the viewer to fully appreciate the subject. Photos with poor focus, inadequate lighting, unclear details, or color inaccuracy should receive lower scores.

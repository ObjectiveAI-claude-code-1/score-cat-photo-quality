    "spec": "Assess the sharpness and focus quality of the cat in the photograph. Evaluate whether the cat is sharp and in-focus, with particular attention to whether the photographer's focus point is on the cat (ideally the eyes). Assess the appropriateness of the depth of field - whether the cat is sharp while the background is appropriately blurred or sharp depending on the composition. Rate how effectively the photograph preserves fine details of the cat's fur, features, and form through sharp focus. A well-focused photograph should clearly render the cat's eyes, whiskers, fur texture, and other details.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the lighting quality and effectiveness in the photograph. Assess whether the lighting is appropriate for revealing detail and texture in the cat's fur and features. Consider the direction, intensity, and quality of the light source - whether it creates flattering shadows, reveals form and dimension, and avoids harsh overexposure or underexposure. Evaluate whether the lighting allows the viewer to fully appreciate the cat as the subject. Good lighting should illuminate the cat's features clearly while creating depth and dimension, making the cat visually distinct and appealing.",

    "spec": "Evaluate the clarity of fine details and the accuracy of color reproduction in the photograph. Assess whether fine details such as individual hairs, whisker definition, eye clarity, nose texture, and paw pads are rendered clearly and distinctly. Evaluate the accuracy of color reproduction - whether the cat's coat color, eye color, and environmental colors appear natural and true to life. Assess whether the photograph faithfully captures the cat's appearance without color casts, oversaturation, or loss of color accuracy that would diminish the viewer's ability to appreciate the subject.",
